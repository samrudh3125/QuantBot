## Quantbot: An Arbitrage Trading Bot

**Description:**

Quantbot is a TypeScript-based trading bot designed to exploit arbitrage opportunities in markets with low liquidity. It leverages Kubernetes for scalable and efficient deployment, ensuring optimal resource utilization.

**Key Features:**

* **Arbitrage Opportunity Detection:** Analyzes market data to discover profitable arbitrage opportunities across multiple markets.
* **Kubernetes Deployment:** Utilizes Kubernetes to create new bot instances for targeted markets, ensuring scalability and efficiency.
* **Docker Image:** Provides a pre-packaged Docker image of the bot, simplifying deployment and management.
* **Monitoring:** Employs Prometheus and Grafana to monitor the latency of each bot instance and detect inactive markets.
* **Dynamic Scaling:** Automatically shuts down inactive bot instances to optimize resource allocation.

**Workflow:**

1. **Market Selection:** The trader identifies markets with low liquidity that are suitable for arbitrage trading.
2. **Bot Deployment:** The trader executes a CLI command to deploy a new bot instance on Kubernetes, passing the target market information.
3. **Arbitrage Opportunity Detection:** The bot analyzes market data to find profitable arbitrage opportunities.
4. **Trading Execution:** The bot executes trades to exploit the arbitrage opportunities.
5. **Monitoring:** Prometheus collects metrics on bot performance and latency.
6. **Scaling:** If a bot instance remains inactive for a specified period, it is automatically shut down.

**Technology Stack:**

* **Programming Language:** TypeScript
* **Containerization:** Docker
* **Orchestration:** Kubernetes
* **Monitoring:** Prometheus and Grafana

**Installation and Usage:**

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/quantbot.git
   ```

2. **Build the Docker image:**

   ```bash
   cd quantbot
   docker build -t quantbot .
   ```

3. **Deploy the bot:**

   - Use Kubernetes commands to deploy the bot image to your cluster, passing the desired market information as environment variables.

**Kubernetes Deployment:**

Kubernetes provides a robust platform for managing the deployment, scaling, and lifecycle of the bot instances. By leveraging Kubernetes, you can:

* **Dynamic Scaling:** Automatically scale the number of bot instances based on workload demands.
* **Resource Management:** Allocate appropriate resources (CPU, memory) to each bot instance.
* **High Availability:** Ensure that the bot instances are distributed across multiple nodes for redundancy and fault tolerance.
* **Configuration Management:** Easily manage configuration settings for the bot instances.

**Prometheus and Grafana:**

Prometheus is a time series database that collects metrics from the bot instances. Grafana provides a powerful visualization tool to analyze and monitor these metrics. By using Prometheus and Grafana, you can:

* **Track Performance:** Monitor the bot's latency, throughput, and other key performance indicators.
* **Detect Anomalies:** Identify unusual patterns or deviations in the bot's behavior.
* **Optimize Performance:** Make data-driven decisions to improve the bot's efficiency.

For now the code consists of just the image of the bot but will complete the project when time permits.
